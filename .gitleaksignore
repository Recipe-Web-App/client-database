# Gitleaks ignore patterns
# Use this file to exclude false positives from secret scanning
# See https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks#gitleaksignore

# Example patterns (uncomment and modify as needed):

# Ignore specific files
# docs/examples/sample-config.yaml:1

# Ignore specific commit SHAs
# commit:a1b2c3d4e5f6

# Ignore specific fingerprints (gitleaks will show these in output)
# fingerprint:12345678

# Common false positives to ignore:

# Example configuration files with placeholder secrets
# k8s/secret.yaml.example:*
# .env.example:*

# Test fixtures with fake credentials
# db/fixtures/*:*

# Documentation with example credentials
# docs/*:generic-api-key

# If you need to ignore a specific line, run gitleaks and it will show you the fingerprint
# Then add the fingerprint here with a comment explaining why it's safe:
# fingerprint:abc123def456  # This is a test API key, not a real secret
